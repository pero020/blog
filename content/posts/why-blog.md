My take on why people start blogging is to leave a footprint in the world. It doesn't matter how small and insignificant the footprint is, but the fact that it exists makes us feel like our life is being observed. Does someone think good or bad about the blog doesn't really matter, the act of someone putting thought into it at all produces a feeling of worthiness. The possibility that one day, someone might find your writing interesting might just be a good enough motivaton to keep doing it.

Many people say that they blog only for themselves, but I don't believe that. They could just blog on their smartphone's _notes_ app and be happy with it. If you went thru the hassle of setting this up, there must be a reason why. Maybe the reason is not the one above, but there is surely something, and I want to know what that something is for me. Hopefully, after many more of these, I will understand this _me_ a bit better.
