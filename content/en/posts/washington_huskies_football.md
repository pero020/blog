However, in light of the recent conference realignment, Washington is set to join the Big Ten Conference starting in the 2024 season.

### Home Field Advantage: Husky Stadium

Husky Stadium, opened in 1920, has been the fierce battleground for Husky home games. Nestled on the shores of Lake Washington, its picturesque setting is complemented by one of the loudest environments in college football. The stadium can hold more than 70,000 fans, making it a formidable place for visiting teams. Over the years, it has undergone several renovations to enhance the fan experience while preserving its historic charm.

By the end of the 2023 season, the Huskies had accumulated 422 conference victories, ranking second in conference historyâ€”a testament to their sustained excellence.

## Quarterback U: A Legacy of Passing Excellence

Washington is often dubbed "Quarterback U," owing to its impressive lineage of quarterbacks who have transitioned to successful careers in the NFL. Dating back to Warren Moon in 1976, the Huskies have produced 17 quarterbacks in the last 23 years who have led the team in passing and have made their mark in the NFL. Notably, the program has the second-most quarterback starts in NFL history, demonstrating its impact on professional football.
