A common perception of introverts and extroverts is that they are just the way they are. You might be introverted, extroverted or somewhere in the middle, but people don't seem to question the reason behind it, they just claim themselves and others to be one. 

Extroverts get energy from social interactions and introverts lose energy from social interactions. Why is that so? I came to an idea it might be heavily correlated with their ability to express their unfiltered selves in their everyday interactions. Of course, making a facade uses energy. Of course, introverts don't get as tired from spending time with their closest friend when that facade is much thinner with them. If we consider expressing ourselves an ability, it should be possible to improve it. Some people have been improving it from their birth, mostly due to a parenting style, and have become great at it. The rest of us were not so lucky, but there is surely a way for us to improve too. It is hard to become as good at playing the piano as a musician practicing from the age of three, but you can definitely learn to play some songs you like.

What is the best way to start improving? I don't know, but I will start by acknowledging the need for an improvement and the positive changes it may produce in my life. We will see after that. Usually you figure something out if you believe in it.
