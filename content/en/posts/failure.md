Have you ever learned something from success? I can't remember much from the top of my head. I learned to be a better friend by realizing I'm not, I learned to program by failing constantly and learning from the mistakes, I learned not to worry about unimportant events in my life by seeing the outcome of doing the opposite. If I didn't learn from my failure, I had learned from other people's failures. 

I will stop listening to success stories and start listening to mistakes people make. When someone tells me how they tried to bake a bread and the 5th attempt succeeded, I will ask about the reasons 4 of them didn't. When looking for advice on a good relationship, I want to hear as many bad ones as possible. But just listening to a story doesn't make us any different. We are animals and, therefore, we are built to avoid pain. Pain might just be the only way to change. Listening to another's story has very little impact on our character compared to developing the empathy to relive their pain from their point of view. Some people have more and some have less empathy built into them, but I am sure that with enough mental capacity, it is possible to develop more, and therefore, to learn more from others' mistakes instead of our own. While learning from our own failures might be more effective, we only have time for a limited number of them.
