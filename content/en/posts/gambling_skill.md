When is gambling worth it? Generally, when reaching our goal using our skills and abilities is less likely to work than by luck. That scenario makes gambling the better option, but how do you determine the odds for the right play?

We can imagine a professional game of poker. That game is joined by a newbie who barely knows the rules of the game. He thinks he's better off-to take a single 10% odds, zero-skill, high risk play, than a series of low risk plays, in which, because of better players around him, he is at a disadvantage. The newbie would be right, while a professional player that believes he is better than others would not agree on a one-time 10-90 odds on him winning the game, a person that believes his chances of winning the game are normally close to 0%, would. This is also an explanation of "beginners' luck" in poker., the statistics didn't have time to catch up to them yet.

The same applies to a regular person gambling via lottery. If they do not see the other way to "get rich", and that is their ultimate goal, how could we blame them for making the higher-risk play? Objectively, getting rich through the lottery is never a good play, but from their perspective, it is. 

Here we come back to the question of subjectivity in determining the skill vs gambling odds. Most lottery players likely subconsciously think some of the following:
- It requires no effort
- It's such a small amount of money
- The benefit I would have in my everyday life from that small amount of money is nothing compared to being rich
- ...

But we know it's not worth it. Some of us know a hundred ways that their extra money could be used to become rich one day. But most of those ways require skills, knowledge, time or some other factor that people playing the lottery do not want to, or can't, compromise with. Many of them are not crazy delusional people, they just have different needs and wants. If you play the lottery with all of this in mind, I support you. Lottery is then not the problem. Maybe it's laziness, lack of money-making skills, lack of time and so on, and those are the areas to work on (if they want to become rich one day), instead of simply quitting playing the lottery. You can't tell a man that their way to reach a goal has low odds of success and then, as an alternative, offer no other way.

Wanting to become rich as a life goal, is a discussion for another time.

Being a board game "Risk" enjoyer myself, I often notice this behavior in new players. They are much more likely to attack unpredictably because that is a better winning strategy than playing what they think is "optimal" and eventually losing to a higher skill player that knows "optimal" a bit better.

In a casino, every game has some form of a house cut. From every game they offer, the house always takes a small amount of money for themselves. This is why the house always wins, and this is why betting in a casino is always considered an unfair bet. A fair bet would be one where the money is put into the bet and the money gotten out of the bet is returned considering the odds. A game of poker is an unfair bet in a casino, because the casino always takes a cut, but a game of poker with friends is a fair bet, in which the odds are determined by an individual player's skill. The game is still of high variance, but skill is the only factor determining if you are entering the table with an advantage or disadvantage.

Opening a business can also be looked at as a bet in which business-oriented skills create advantage or disadvantage, but variance can still make you profitable or not. The reason why a lottery ticket could be a better choice than opening a business is that the bar to entry for opening a business is 1000 times more money than buying a lottery ticket, and even if that money was saved, the person doing it might be at such a big disadvantage due to their business abilities, that a lottery ticket is more worth it.

I believe that every person has something that is a better option to become rich than a lottery ticket, and I hope that people will stop giving the government even more money through them.
