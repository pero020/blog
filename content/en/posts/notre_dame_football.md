With a history that can be traced back to 1887, the Fighting Irish are renowned for their rich traditions, remarkable achievements, and unwavering loyalty from their supporters.

## A Home in Notre Dame Stadium

They are, however, tied to the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) for all sports except for rugby, and they play five games a year against ACC schools. This unique arrangement gives them the flexibility to maintain their rich tradition while also competing at a high level.

### Undefeated Seasons

Notre Dame has enjoyed **22 undefeated seasons**, among which are **12 perfect seasons**—an incredible feat in the realm of college football where the competition is intense, and unbeaten runs are rare.

### Victories and Recognitions

With **948 official victories**, Notre Dame ranks among the winningest teams in NCAA football history. It's worth noting that there are **21 additional victories** that were vacated by the NCAA in 2016 due to self-reported academic misconduct, underscoring the challenges and controversies that occasionally accompany such a storied program.

## Television and Cultural Impact

Since 1991, Notre Dame home games have been televised by **NBC**, making them one of the first college football programs to establish such a strong media partnership. This broadcast deal has amplified the team's reach, introducing Notre Dame football to a national audience and facilitating a cult-like following across the country.

## A Cultivated Tradition
